# it was all a dream

I was scheduled to have a full-stack interview today. I woke up in the middle of the night convinced that the interview question would have something to do with users crafting custom formulas in a frontend and the backend doing the math.

The interview had some technical issues and has been postponed, but I was mentally ready for a coding interview, so I took the exercise I dreamed about.

I will follow up with details about the actual interview question to let you know whether I am clairvoyant.
